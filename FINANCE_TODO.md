# DubPrime Portfolio Simulator - Financial Validation Checklist

## Cash Flow Model Validation

- [ ] Verify payment calculation factors match standard financial formulas
- [ ] Confirm amortization schedule accurately reflects level-payment structure
- [ ] Validate treatment of partial period interest calculations
- [ ] Ensure reinvestment mechanics align with private credit market practices
- [ ] Verify cash waterfall priority (defaults → interest → principal) matches industry standards

## Default Modeling

- [ ] Validate hazard rate methodology for multi-month tenors
- [ ] Compare default timing assumptions against historical loan performance data
- [ ] Test if default distribution across portfolio tenors is realistic
- [ ] Verify partial defaults are handled correctly (not just binary default/no-default)
- [ ] Validate recovery assumptions and post-default cash flows

## Yield Calculations

- [ ] Verify MOIC calculations properly account for the time value of money
- [ ] Confirm net yield accounts for defaults correctly
- [ ] Validate that yields reflect actual realized returns (not just projected)
- [ ] Add IRR calculations alongside MOIC for more complete return metrics
- [ ] Include risk-adjusted return metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio equivalents)

## Outstanding Balance Calculations

- [ ] Verify that outstanding balance calculations properly account for amortization
- [ ] Confirm net vs. gross outstanding differentiation is financially sound
- [ ] Validate weighted calculations for multi-period loans
- [ ] Test edge cases (early repayment, 100% default scenarios)

## Visualization Accuracy

- [ ] Confirm stacked charts correctly represent portfolio composition
- [ ] Verify that default overlays accurately represent timing of losses
- [ ] Validate that cumulative metrics add up correctly in charts
- [ ] Ensure y-axis scales are appropriate for financial interpretation

## Financial Cohesion Tests

- [ ] Perform a full cycle test: confirm total inflows equal initial capital + interest - defaults
- [ ] Verify conservation of value across all charts and calculations
- [ ] Test that monthly cash components (defaults, interest, principal) sum to expected amounts
- [ ] Validate that ending portfolio value + cumulative cash flows = initial capital + returns

## Market Realism Checks

- [ ] Compare default rates with real private credit market benchmarks
- [ ] Verify interest rate ranges align with current market conditions
- [ ] Test allocation mixes that reflect actual private credit portfolios
- [ ] Validate tenor distribution against typical short-term loan portfolios

## Additional Financial Metrics to Consider

- [ ] Add loss-given-default (LGD) parameters instead of assuming 100% loss
- [ ] Implement concentration risk metrics
- [ ] Add vintage analysis capabilities
- [ ] Include stress testing scenarios for various market conditions
- [ ] Add volatility/variance metrics for cash flows

## Documentation Needs

- [ ] Document all financial assumptions clearly for users
- [ ] Provide methodology explanations for key calculations
- [ ] Include glossary of financial terms used in the simulator
- [ ] Add benchmark comparison options in the interface
